# Research-Project

## Main class 

The main class sets up the learners that are experimented with. Variables that need to be defined are type of learners used, type of hyperparameter grid, 
hyperparameter values  for the tuned learners, datasets used, number of stratified splits that need to be made. 

## Experimental_setup class 

This class constructs the learning curves. 

## experimental_fitting class

This class plots the learning curves. For each dataset the learning curves are displayed for the default learner as well as the hyperparameter tuned learner.
